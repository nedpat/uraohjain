The CareerDriver offers a versatile and flexible way to develop your skills. The service is designed to support you on your journey towards achieving your professional goals. The CareerDriver period starts with face-to-face meetings with experienced counsellors and feedback on your own work is provided throughout the period. Distance working gives you the freedom to learn and work in a way that suits you.

The meetings with the counsellors and the wellbeing discussions that are part of the service take place at Metropolia's Â Myllypuro campus.
