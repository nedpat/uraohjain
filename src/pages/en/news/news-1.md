The service is intended for unemployed job seeker clients of Helsinki Employment Services looking to find employment in the fields of ICT, software development and media. The applicant must have an upper secondary or higher education degree. The service enables clients to clarify their own career goals and receive guidance for aspects such as marketing their own know-how. Developing one’s know-how is a way to meet the changing needs of working life. Promoting wellbeing that supports everyday life and employment is part of the CareerDriver service. The duration of the service is 3–6 months. The service is provided in Finnish and English.

You can join the service by signing up on the CareerDriver website when the operation launches. The CareerDriver website will serve as a registration platform and a channel that provides information about the service. You can sign up for the service via the front page or the ‘Sign up’ tab in the top bar. The website will provide information about the study offerings available and the project itself. The ‘News’ section will feature more detailed news and information about upcoming events.

The CareerDriver service is provided in collaboration between Helsinki Vocational College, Laurea University of Applied Sciences and Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Helsinki Employment Services serves as a close cooperation partner.
